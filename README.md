wp-ajax-custom
==============

Lightweight ajax loader for WordPress that can be added to any theme.

Adds `wp_custom_ajax_` and `wp_custom_ajax_nopriv_` hooks that work like the `wp_ajax` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_` hooks.

The file is set up for placement inside your theme's directory, but you can define the location of the `wp-load.php` file by changing the `$wp_load` variable.
